Repo consists of these machine learning builds-

Clustering Techniques: Hierarchical (nested clusters create parent-child relationship/s) and Partitioning (no overlapping between clusters). 

Data Preprocessing (Data Reduction by Feature Extraction): Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Association Rule Learning (Data Mining): Apriori Algorithm.
