# Unsupervised-Algorithms-
Repo consists of these machine learning builds-
Clustering Techniques: Hierarchical (nested clusters create parent-child relationship/s) and Partitioning (no overlapping between clusters). 
Data Preprocessing (Data Reduction by Feature Extraction): Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
Association Rule Learning (Data Mining): Apriori Algorithm.
